# factorial

In this example, was create a Java program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion. The user is prompted to enter a number, and the program will compute the factorial using the calculateFactorial() method.
To use this, create a new file named FactorialCalculator.java and copy the above code into it. Then, compile and run the program using a Java compiler.
Here's how you can do it in the command line:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where FactorialCalculator.java is located using the cd command.
Compile the Java program by running: javac FactorialCalculator.java
Run the program using: java FactorialCalculator
You will be prompted to enter a non-negative integer. Once you enter the number, the program will calculate and display its factorial.
Keep in mind that the factorial function grows very quickly, and for large numbers, it can result in very large values.
